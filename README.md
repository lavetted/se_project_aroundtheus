# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Project Description

This project is a dynamic and interactive website that showcases an explorer's journey across the U.S. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an engaging experience for users. Key features include:

Semantic HTML: Utilization of semantic tags like <header>, <main>, and <footer> ensures that the website is well-structured and accessible.

Responsive Design: CSS media queries are employed to provide a seamless experience across various devices, ensuring that the layout adapts perfectly to different screen sizes.

Interactive Elements: JavaScript is used for DOM manipulation, enabling users to interact with buttons and mark their favorite locations. This functionality allows for a personalized user experience.

Dynamic Content: The website dynamically updates content based on user interactions, providing real-time feedback and a more engaging browsing experience.

Visual Styling: Custom CSS styles enhance the visual appeal of the site, making it visually attractive and easy to navigate.

Explore the journey, interact with the map, and mark the places you love. This project is a testament to my skills in web development, combining modern techniques to create a functional and engaging website.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**  
  
* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)  
  
**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
